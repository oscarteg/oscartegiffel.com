            me in the computer from an early age and through proper guidance and
            training it has led to a passion for technology. I have a broad
            field of interest and that can also be seen in the various
            techniques and technologies I have used the years. During and after
            his studies, I mainly developed in the field of web development.
          </p>

            architectures. I can be described as a social, enthusiastic and
            communicatively skilled software engineer. I have a passion for my
            profession, work hard and like to contribute to a positive working
            atmosphere. My ambition is to work in a dynamic environment with an
