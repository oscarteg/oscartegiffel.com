A common task in JavaScript, a language that is easy to learn but full of nuances, is copying objects. Let's explore how to do this effectively.

### ES5 Clone Function

In ES5, we often used a custom clone function:

```javascript
// ES5 clone function
function clone(obj) {
    if (null == obj || "object" != typeof obj) return obj;
    var copy = obj.constructor();
    for (var attr in obj) {
        if (obj.hasOwnProperty(attr)) copy[attr] = obj[attr];
    }
    return copy;
}

var obj = { a: 1, b: 2, c: [1, 2, 3]};
var copy = clone(obj);
```

### ES6 Spread Operator

With ES6, we shifted to using the spread operator:

```javascript
// ES6 spread operator
const obj = { a: 1, b: 2, c: [1, 2, 3]};
const copy = { ...obj };
```

These were the primary solutions available at the time. However, both create a shallow copy, which can lead to unexpected behaviors.

### Shallow Copy Issue

A shallow copy only duplicates the first level of the object:

```javascript
const obj = { a: 1, b: 2, c: [1, 2, 3]};
const copy = { ...obj };
copy.c.push(4);
console.log(obj.c); // Output: [1, 2, 3, 4]
console.log(copy.c); // Output: [1, 2, 3, 4]
```

The modification of `copy.c` also affects `obj.c` because they reference the same array. This illustrates the limitations of shallow copying.

### Deep Copy with JSON Methods

To create a deep copy, one common method is using JSON:

```javascript 
const obj = { a: 1, b: 2, c: [1, 2, 3]};
const copy = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(obj));
copy.a = 3;
console.log(obj.a); // Output: 1
console.log(copy.a); // Output: 3
```

This method is straightforward but has limitations, including poor performance and inability to handle certain data types and circular references.

### Deep Copy with `structuredClone`

The most recent and optimal solution is `structuredClone`:

```javascript
const obj = { a: 1, b: 2, c: [1, 2, 3]};
const copy = structuredClone(obj);
copy.a = 3;
console.log(obj.a); // Output: 1
console.log(copy.a); // Output: 3
```

`structuredClone` is fast, supports all data types, and handles circular references. It's supported by all major browsers.

> **Note:** `structuredClone` does not clone functions, DOM nodes, property descriptors, setters, or getters. Also, the prototype chain is not duplicated, so the clone is no longer an instance of the original class.

### Conclusion

Understanding the nuances of copying objects in JavaScript is crucial for ensuring data integrity and avoiding unexpected behaviors in your applications. Depending on your needs, you can choose between shallow and deep copying methods, each with its own use cases and limitations.
