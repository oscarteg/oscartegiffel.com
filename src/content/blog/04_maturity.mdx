I tried to write this on my 31st birthday but what I wrote didn't resonate with me after. I wanted to explain how I changed after this era in my life. How reflecting back on the person I was, and looking at the person I wanted to be gave me new insights to change.

"Does anybody have any ideas on this? Why isn't this finished? You told me it would be done!" Every type of confrontation I built up in my head and gave me a bad feeling about myself. I didn't take ownership or the responsibility that was needed. Hard conversations I avoided like the plague and really .

As I write this on my 31st birthday, I have been reflecting on the past year. During this time, several people have told me something that has stuck with me: "You have grown." I've heard this from various individuals, including those close to me, colleagues, and even people I don't talk to frequently. It made me wonder, what is it that people are noticing?

Turning 30 was a significant milestone in my life. I became more serious about determining where I wanted to go in life and who I wanted to be. My number one goal was to know myself better and express that self-authentically. I looked to those around me for inspiration, shaping the person I aspired to be.

I eventually decided that personal growth was essential. I aimed to be more assertive, vulnerable, open, and honest. I wanted to become more confident in who I am and what I can achieve. Taking a course and discussing these subjects with everyone around me became part of my journey, and it resulted in tremendous personal growth and learning.

Now, as I look at myself, I feel genuinely happy with who I am, and it shows. I take ownership of my strengths and weaknesses, acknowledging both the things I excel at and the areas I need to improve.

A step into the right direction
A moment to stand still in reflection
