As I write this on my 31st birthday, I have been reflecting on the past year. During this time, several people have told me something that has stuck with me: "You have grown." I've heard this from various individuals, including those close to me, colleagues, and even people I don't talk to frequently. It made me wonder, what is it that people are noticing?

Turning 30 was a significant milestone in my life. I became more serious about determining where I wanted to go in life and who I wanted to be. My number one goal was to know myself better and express that self-authentically. I looked to those around me for inspiration, shaping the person I aspired to be.

I eventually decided that personal growth was essential. I aimed to be more assertive, vulnerable, open, and honest. I wanted to become more confident in who I am and what I can achieve. Taking a course and discussing these subjects with everyone around me became part of my journey, and it resulted in tremendous personal growth and learning.

Now, as I look at myself, I feel genuinely happy with who I am, and it shows. I take ownership of my strengths and weaknesses, acknowledging both the things I excel at and the areas I need to improve.
