Just jotting down some key points about `satisfies` because I keep mixing up its use cases with type annotations.

Here's the thing - `satisfies` is like a type-checker that doesn't narrow down the type inference. Think of it as telling TypeScript "hey, verify this matches the type, but don't lock it down."

```typescript
// With type annotation
const colors: Record<string, string> = {
  primary: '#0047AB',
  secondary: '#6082B6'
} // Type is exactly Record<string, string>

// With satisfies
const colors2 = {
  primary: '#0047AB',
  secondary: '#6082B6'
} satisfies Record<string, string>
// Type preserves literal types: { primary: "#0047AB", secondary: "#6082B6" }
```

The real magic happens when combining `as const` with `satisfies`. It's like putting your object in a type-safe freezer:

```typescript
const theme = {
  colors: {
    primary: '#0047AB',
    secondary: '#6082B6'
  },
  fontSize: {
    small: 12,
    medium: 16
  }
} as const satisfies {
  colors: Record<string, string>,
  fontSize: Record<string, number>
}

// Now we get autocomplete for 'primary' and 'secondary'
// AND type checking ensures we're using strings for colors
theme.colors.primary // Autocomplete works!
```

## Real-World Use Cases

An common use case I encountered is when working with API responses.

### API Response Typing

When dealing with API responses, `satisfies` shines by ensuring type safety while preserving specific values:

```typescript
const apiResponse = {
  status: 200,
  data: {
    users: [{
      id: 1,
      role: 'admin' as 'admin' | 'user'
    }]
  }
} satisfies APIResponse
// Now we get exact types for status (200) and role ('admin')
```

### Configuration Objects

Perfect for environment variables and feature flags:

```typescript
const config = {
  api: {
    endpoint: process.env.API_ENDPOINT,
    timeout: 5000
  },
  features: {
    darkMode: true,
    beta: {
      enabled: false,
      users: ['admin@example.com']
    }
  }
} as const satisfies AppConfig

// TypeScript knows config.features.darkMode is specifically boolean
// and config.features.beta.users is readonly string[]
```

## Common Gotchas

1. Array Type Inference:

```typescript
// ❌ This loses tuple type inference
const tuple = [1, 'two', true] satisfies [number, string, boolean]
// ✅ Use as const to preserve tuple types
const tuple = [1, 'two', true] as const satisfies readonly [number, string, boolean]
```

2. Nested Object Properties:

```typescript
const settings = {
  theme: {
    colors: {
      primary: '#000'
    }
  }
} satisfies Settings
// Without as const, theme.colors.primary is still widened to string
```

> Note to future self: Use `satisfies` when you want type checking without losing literal types, and combine with `as const` when you want both immutability and precise type inference. Type annotations are still useful when you explicitly want to widen the type.
