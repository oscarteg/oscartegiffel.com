The modern web is becoming a battleground, with two opposing forces pulling it in different directions. On one side, we have the commercial, advertisement-driven web, where clicks are the ultimate goal. It is a space dominated by monopolies, inundating us with ads, notifications, and intrusive tracking. It feels like a Blade Runner-inspired cyberpunk dystopia, with the essence of the web lost in the pursuit of profit.

Then, there's the tech-savvy web users, who seek refuge from the bombardment of ads and surveillance. They install adblockers, explore alternative networks like Mastodon and Gemini, and even take a humorous approach by building true HTML and JavaScript-less pages to mock the complexities of the modern web.

The gap between these two extremes is widening, and users are forced to choose a camp. While browsing the "normal web," we often need to disable antifeature-blockers to access content. It can be frustrating and overwhelming, but many of us are no longer willing to compromise.

I, too, resonate with this sentiment. I have stopped bothering with broken links or wrangled pages caused by blocking third-party JavaScript. Instead, I choose to spend my time elsewhere, seeking more meaningful interactions on the web. I've found solace in using kagi.com, a search engine that comes with a "non-commercial lens," filtering out highly commercial content. Additionally, I manually deprioritize domains like Facebook and LinkedIn, escaping the grip of their never-ending ads.

What's fascinating is that by blocking analytics and ad networks, I am also disappearing from their view. It's a small victory in reclaiming privacy and autonomy on the web. I can't help but feel more disconnected from the "MBA, designers, and marketers web" each day. It's a space optimized by analytics targeting users who don't block them, while I continue to distance myself from that commercial realm.

When I genuinely need to interact with certain websites, it can be a nerve-wracking experience. I've started preferring phone calls or simple emails, bypassing convoluted web interfaces and account creations. I walk or cycle to stores, enjoying the opportunity to engage with real people, seek advice, and exchange items without the hassle of online orders and deliveries.

Despite detaching from the mainstream web, I've experienced an unexpected surge in meaningful interactions. My blog posts have garnered more emails and thoughtful comments, and I engage in captivating discussions on platforms like Mastodon. I am inundated with insightful content from various sources, ranging from RSS feeds to Gemini and Hacker News. Surprisingly, many of these sources are minimalistic and user-friendly, resonating with both tech-savvy and non-tech users alike.

It feels like the web is dividing itself into two distinct entities. The commercialized side continues its relentless pursuit of profit, while those who seek simplicity and genuine connections sail away from the big monopolies. We are either dedicating our CPU cycles to JavaScript tracking or rediscovering the essence of the web through handcrafted HTML.

As I reflect on this journey, I can't help but draw parallels to the "dark web" that journalists are so intrigued by. But my intention is not to delve into the illicit activities associated with that term. Rather, I feel like part of a "dark web" where discussions can thrive without intrusive ads and surveillance.

More than ever, I realize that it's not me who's the outsider; it's the people consumed by advertising and the pursuit of profit. They are the ones damaging the web and our planet. As we detach from their world, we find solace in simplicity, genuine interactions, and meaningful content.

If you, too, seek refuge from the commercialization of the web, now is the time to embrace a simpler path. Welcome aboard as we navigate the beauty of a web that values people over profits. Together, we can shape a web that truly reflects the essence of human connection and creativity.
