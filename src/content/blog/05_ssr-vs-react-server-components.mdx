## Prerequisites
- [React Server Components](https://reactjs.org/blog/2020/12/21/data-fetching-with-react-server-components.html)
- Basic knowledge of [Server Side Rendering](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-dom-server.html#rendertopipeablestream)

Embarking on a journey through the history of web development, we transition from the basic Multi-Page Apps (MPAs) to the more intricate Single Page Apps (SPAs), and now, an exciting fusion called Progressively Enhanced Single Page Apps (PESPAs). This evolution sets the stage for exploring Server-Side Rendering (SSR) and the game-changing Server Components, promising a fresh approach to creating dynamic and interactive web experiences.

## SSR
- We use renderToPipeableStream. Other methods are renderToString to fetch only the HTML a single time.

Notes: 
- React Server Components does not hydrate
- SSR sends a React readable string and not real HTML
- NextJS no server components in a client component
