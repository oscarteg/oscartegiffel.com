Notes: 
- React Server Components does not hydrate
- NextJS no server components in a client component   


## Introduction
- Briefly explain the significance of server-side rendering (SSR) and its benefits for web applications.
- Introduce React Server Components as a new paradigm in web development.
- Set the context for the blog post by highlighting the need for a more efficient approach to rendering in modern web applications.

## Client-Side Rendering (CSR) vs. Server-Side Rendering (SSR)
- Define and explain client-side rendering (CSR) and server-side rendering (SSR).
- Highlight the key differences between the two approaches in terms of initial load time, SEO, and user experience.
- Discuss the limitations of CSR and how it can lead to performance issues, especially in large-scale applications.

## Introducing React Server Components
- Provide an overview of React Server Components and their purpose in the React ecosystem.
- Explain how React Server Components combine the benefits of SSR and client-side interactivity.
- Discuss the motivation behind the development of React Server Components and how they address the limitations of traditional SSR and CSR.

## How React Server Components Work
- Dive into the technical aspects of React Server Components.
- Explain the process of rendering server components on the server-side and sending the pre-rendered content to the client.
- Illustrate the concept of granular server-side rendering and its impact on performance and scalability.

## Benefits of React Server Components
- Discuss the advantages of React Server Components over traditional SSR and CSR.
- Explore the improved performance, reduced time-to-interactive, and enhanced SEO achieved through granular server-side rendering.
- Highlight how React Server Components promote code splitting, leading to smaller JavaScript bundles and faster initial load times.

## Reusability and Composition
- Emphasize the reusability and composability of React Server Components, similar to client-side components.
- Explain how React Server Components can be nested and composed, making the codebase cleaner and more maintainable.
- Discuss the potential for code-sharing between client-side and server components.

## The Future of React Server Components
- Address the experimental nature of React Server Components and its current status in the React ecosystem.
- Speculate on the potential impact of React Server Components on the future of web development.
- Highlight the community's response and involvement in shaping the future of this new feature.

## Conclusion
- Recap the key points discussed in the blog post, summarizing the differences between SSR and React Server Components.
- Emphasize the advantages of React Server Components in terms of performance, scalability, and user experience.
- Encourage readers to explore and experiment with React Server Components as a promising solution for building modern web applications.
