- What are the different build systems?

- Webpack
- SWC (Rust)
- Esbuild (Go)
- Typescript (TSC)

  - What is a build system?

- rather difficult ecosystem for building libraries
- package.json is a mess
- moduleResolution is a mess
- most options are unused when using a different build system
- no clear way to build a library
- Appearantly you are using the typescript implementation of typecrcript for declaration files but the esbuild implementation for the actual code??
- Can cause problems
