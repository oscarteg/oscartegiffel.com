I love learning new programming languages and discovering improvements i can make in my skills. One thing I discovered a while ago was _pattern matching_ in Rust and was wondering if we could have the same in Typescript.

Welcome to this exploration of pattern matching, a powerful technique used in functional programming. However, it’s not limited to that paradigm alone; for example, Rust makes extensive use of it. If you’re a TypeScript developer interested in bringing the elegance and utility of pattern matching into your projects, you’re in the right place. In this post, we’ll examine how pattern matching is implemented in Rust and how you can use similar constructs in TypeScript.

## Problem Statement

Imagine you are building a weather forecasting application. You receive data in various formats—XML, JSON, plain text, etc.—and from multiple providers. You must filter this data to extract essential information like temperature, wind speed, and humidity. This is a typical scenario where pattern matching shines. In a language that supports pattern matching out-of-the-box, this could be a breeze. However, if the language lacks native support, like JavaScript, you’ll find yourself bogged down with complex if-else conditional logic, making your code less readable and harder to maintain.

Great, let’s move on to the next sections where we’ll dive deeper into the technical details. Following your outline, these sections will focus on the solutions offered by Rust and TypeScript for pattern matching.

## Rust’s Approach to Pattern Matching

Rust provides a native solution for pattern matching using the `match` keyword. This feature is incredibly versatile, allowing you to match against literals, variables, and even destructured types. Here’s how it works:

```rust
match VALUE {
    PATTERN => EXPRESSION,
    PATTERN => EXPRESSION,
    PATTERN => EXPRESSION,
}
```

For example, if you’re dealing with an enum like `Weather`, Rust makes it straightforward to match each condition.

```rust
enum Weather { 
	Sunny, 
	Cloudy, 
	Rainy
} 

fn print_weather(weather: Weather) { 
	match weather { 
		Weather::Sunny => println!(“It’s a sunny day!”),
		Weather::Cloudy => println!(“It’s a cloudy day.”),
		Weather::Rainy => println!(“It’s raining outside.”), 
	} 
}

```

### Rust: Exhaustive Checking Ensures All Cases Are Handled

For example, if you later added a `BadRequest` variant to the `HttpResponse` enum in Rust:

```rust
enum HttpResponse {
    Ok(String),
    NotFound,
    Unauthorized,
    BadRequest,
    ServerError(u16),
    Unknown,
}

```

If you don’t update your `match` expression to handle this new variant, the Rust compiler will throw an error, forcing you to handle the new case:

```rust
fn handle_response(response: HttpResponse) {
    match response {
        HttpResponse::Ok(data) => {
            // ...
        },
        // Compiler will error here, telling you that you missed the `BadRequest` variant
        // ...
    }
}

```

By enforcing exhaustive checking, Rust ensures that you haven’t missed any cases, effectively preventing potential bugs.

### Exhaustive Checking in Rust


One of the key strengths of Rust’s pattern matching is exhaustive checking, which forces you to handle all potential cases, thereby reducing bugs.

```rust
enum TrafficLight {
    Red,
    Yellow,
    Green,
}

fn action_based_on_light(light: TrafficLight) {
    match light {
        TrafficLight::Red => stop(),
        TrafficLight::Yellow => slow_down(),
        TrafficLight::Green => go(),
    }
}

```

In this example, omitting any of the `TrafficLight` variants would result in a compilation error, ensuring that all scenarios are handled.


## TypeScript’s Take on Pattern Matching

While TypeScript doesn’t offer built-in pattern matching, it has discriminated unions and the `switch` statement, which together can mimic some of the functionality.

```typescript
type Shape =
  | { kind: ‘circle’; radius: number }
  | { kind: ‘square’; sideLength: number }
  | { kind: ‘rectangle’; width: number; height: number };

function calculateArea(shape: Shape): number {
  switch (shape.kind) {
    case ‘circle’:
      return Math.PI * shape.radius ** 2;
    case ‘square’:
      return shape.sideLength ** 2;
    case ‘rectangle’:
      return shape.width * shape.height;
    default:
      throw new Error(‘Invalid shape’);
  }
}

```

### Libraries for Enhanced Pattern Matching in TypeScript

To bridge the gap, TypeScript developers can also utilize libraries like `ts-pattern` for more robust pattern matching, similar to Rust’s capabilities.

```typescript
import { match, P } from ‘ts-pattern’;

type Data = 
  | { type: ‘text’; content: string }
  | { type: ‘img’; src: string };

const result = match(data)
  .with({ type: ‘text’ }, (data) => /* handle text data */)
  .with({ type: ‘img’, src: P.select() }, (src) => /* handle image data */)
  .exhaustive();
```

## Comparing Rust and TypeScript

Both Rust and TypeScript offer compelling, albeit different, approaches to pattern matching. Rust provides native support with exhaustive checking, making it a powerful feature for robust and type-safe code. TypeScript, on the other hand, offers flexibility through discriminated unions and libraries, albeit without the strictness of exhaustive checking at the compiler level.

### Pros and Cons

#### Rust

**Pros:**

1. **Type Safety**: Exhaustive checking ensures you handle all cases, enhancing type safety.
2. **Expressiveness**: It allows for deep matching, nested destructuring, and more.
3. **Readability**: Clearer and more concise code that is easier to maintain.

**Cons:**

1. **Learning Curve**: The exhaustive nature may be challenging for beginners.
2. **Verbosity**: Complex nested patterns can sometimes lead to verbose code.

#### TypeScript

**Pros:**

1. **Flexibility**: The `switch` statement and discriminated unions offer a good degree of flexibility.
2. **Extensibility**: Libraries like `ts-pattern` provide even more robust options.
3. **Ease of Adoption**: Easier to integrate into existing JavaScript projects.

**Cons:**

1. **Limited by JavaScript**: As a superset of JavaScript, TypeScript inherits some of its limitations.
2. **No Exhaustive Checking**: The lack of exhaustive checking may result in runtime errors.

## Practical Use-Cases

### Rust

- **Compilers and Interpreters**: Pattern matching aids in parsing and tokenization, simplifying the code logic.
- **Data Transformation Pipelines**: Extracting, transforming, and loading (ETL) data becomes more straightforward.

### TypeScript

- **Redux Reducers**: Enhances code readability and maintainability.
- **API Responses**: Allows for more robust handling of different API response shapes.

### Additional Rust Examples

#### Using Guards in Rust

You can use guards in Rust’s pattern matching to add conditions:

```rust
fn describe_number(x: i32) {
    match x {
        n if n > 0 => println!(“Positive”),
        0 => println!(“Zero”),
        _ => println!(“Negative”),
    }
}
```

#### Matching with Ranges

Rust allows you to match numeric ranges, which can be handy:

```rust
fn grade(score: u8) {
    match score {
        90..=100 => println!(“A”),
        80..=89 => println!(“B”),
        70..=79 => println!(“C”),
        _ => println!(“F”),
    }
}

```

### Additional TypeScript Examples

#### Using `if` with Discriminated Unions

In TypeScript, you can use `if` statements for a more nuanced handling:

```typescript
interface Circle { type: ‘circle’; radius: number; }

interface Square { type: ‘square’; side: number; }

type Shape = Circle | Square;

const printArea = (shape: Shape) => {
  if (shape.type === ‘circle’) {
    console.log(`Area of circle: ${Math.PI * shape.radius ** 2}`);
  } else {
    console.log(`Area of square: ${shape.side ** 2}`);
  }
};
```

### TypeScript: Simulating Exhaustive Checking

In TypeScript, you could achieve a similar effect using a helper function that ensures exhaustiveness. While TypeScript doesn’t enforce this out of the box, you can manually introduce this feature. Here’s how:

First, define a helper function:

```typescript
function assertNever(x: never): never {
    throw new Error(“Unexpected object: “ + x);
}
```

Then, use it in the `default` case of your `switch` statement:

```typescript
type HttpResponse =
  | { type: ‘ok’; data: string }
  // ... (other types)

function handleResponse(response: HttpResponse) {
  switch (response.type) {
    // ... (other cases)
    default:
      assertNever(response);
  }
}

```

With this, if you add a new variant to `HttpResponse` and forget to handle it in `handleResponse`, TypeScript will produce a compile-time error on the `assertNever(response);` line.

#### Nested Pattern Matching with ts-pattern

You can achieve nested pattern matching using libraries like `ts-pattern`:

```typescript
import { match, __ } from ‘ts-pattern’;

type NestedShape =
  | { type: ‘nested’; shape: Shape }
  | Shape;

const handleNestedShape = (shape: NestedShape) =>
  match(shape)
    .with({ type: ‘nested’, shape: { type: ‘circle’, radius: __ } }, ({ radius }) => `Nested circle with radius ${radius}`)
    .with({ type: ‘circle’, radius: __ }, radius => `Simple circle with radius ${radius}`)
    .with({ type: ‘square’, side: __ }, side => `Square with side ${side}`)
    .exhaustive();
```

Exhaustive checking ensures that all possible cases are handled in a `match` expression in Rust or a `switch` statement in TypeScript. This is particularly useful when the codebase evolves and new variants or types are added, helping prevent bugs that could be introduced by unhandled cases.



### Summary

Exhaustive checking helps to make your code safer and more maintainable by ensuring that all cases are explicitly handled. This is crucial in complex systems where overlooking a single case can lead to subtle, hard-to-detect bugs.

Incorporating this discussion on exhaustive checking into your blog post will offer a more rounded view, emphasizing not just the what and how but also the why of pattern matching. Would you like to proceed with adding this section?

## Summary and Conclusion

In the ever-evolving landscape of programming, pattern matching stands as a testament to how older, proven concepts can find new life in modern languages. Rust and TypeScript each offer their unique flavor, optimized for their ecosystems and target audiences. If you’re a developer working with either (or both) of these languages, understanding and leveraging pattern matching can lead to cleaner, more efficient, and robust code.

Whether you aim for the type safety and expressiveness in Rust or the flexibility and ease of adoption in TypeScript, pattern matching has a place in your coding toolbox.
