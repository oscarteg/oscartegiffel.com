I always encourage to try new things and to be an advocate of my own advice, I wanted to try a diffent ORM. I wanted to try Drizzle. 

At first I want my ORM to provide a good DX. A simple clean API that let's me create queries and mutations in a simple way. I also want it to be type safe. I want to be able to use Typescript and have the ORM provide me with type safety.

Drizzle did not provide me that experience. I had a single use case that made me want to switch.

Let's say I have the following schema in drizzle:

```ts
export const users = mysqlTable("users", {
  id: varchar("id", { length: 256 }).primaryKey(),
  name: varchar("name", { length: 256 }).notNull(),
});

export const groups = mysqlTable("groups", {
  id: varchar("id", { length: 256 }).primaryKey(),
  name: varchar("name", { length: 256 }).notNull(),
});

```

> Note: I use varchar as my id because I create my ids in the application and not in the database. I use uuids for that. MySQL does not have `returning` so you can only fetch the last inserted id with `LAST_INSERT_ID()`. Because this function works on a per connection basis and we are creating this application serverless I want to prevent the possiblity of assigning a resource to the wrong id. 

I want to create a many-to-many relationship between these tables. At first you have to create the junction table yourself. Now that is not a big issue but still a little obstacel. Let's do that.


```ts
export const usersRelations = relations(users, ({ many }) => ({
	usersToGroups: many(usersToGroups),
}));
 
export const groupsRelations = relations(groups, ({ many }) => ({
	usersToGroups: many(usersToGroups),
}));
 
export const usersToGroups = mysqlTable('users_to_groups', {
		userId: varchar('user_id').notNull().references(() => users.id),
		groupId: varchar('group_id').notNull().references(() => groups.id),
	}, (t) => ({
		pk: primaryKey(t.userId, t.groupId),
	}),
);
 
export const usersToGroupsRelations = relations(usersToGroups, ({ one }) => ({
	group: one(groups, {
		fields: [usersToGroups.groupId],
		references: [groups.id],
	}),
	user: one(users, {
		fields: [usersToGroups.userId],
		references: [users.id],
	}),
}));
```

This seems alright. Let's look at the api it provides and what it returns.


Fetching a single user with a group:
```ts
await db.query.users.findFirst({
  with: {
    groups: {
      with: {
        group: true,
      },
      where: eq(usersToGroupsRelations.userId, input.id),
    },
  },
  where: eq(usersToGroupsRelations.id, input.id),
});
```

The with field can be passed to include the object

```json
{
  "id": "XRdUD20AfH422nXKI72HW",
  "name": "test",
  "groups": [
      {
          "userId": "XRdUD20AfH422nXKI72HW",
          "groupId": "_VQnVW4cZj4HvnCC1W9Lr",
          "group": {
              "id": "_VQnVW4cZj4HvnCC1W9Lr",
              "name": "sdf",
              "description": "sdf",
              "quantity": 0,
              "unit": "kg"
        }
    }
  ],
}
```
