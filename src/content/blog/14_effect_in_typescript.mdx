In my blog post [Error handling in Typescript](/blog/04_error-handling-in-typescript) I talked about how to handle errors in typescript. This was a simple solution for a larger problem in Typescript where you don't know if a function can fail. There are different libraries to solve this and I recently found [Effect](https://effect.website) which solve this exact problem. In this post I'm going to dive deeper into this library and how much clearer it makes my code.
