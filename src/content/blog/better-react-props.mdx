A simple pattern to have better React props is to use discriminated unions. This is a powerfull pattern that can be used in many different ways. I don't see it utilized as much as I would like. In this post I will show you how to use it to have better React props.

Let's say we have the following component:

```tsx
type Props = {
  onClick: () => void;
};

// The implementation is not important
declare function Button(props: Props): JSX.Element;
```
