I would like to make this comparison: __AI code generation works much like a compiler producing assembly language__. Could a skilled human write better code? Probably. But for most everyday tasks, AI-generated code is simply "good enough." This practical mindset recognizes that perfect code often isn't necessary. Few developers write assembly by hand anymore, and similarly, AI tools can handle routine coding adequately. This frees developers to focus on the creative problem-solving where humans still excel. The important part is recognizing when "good enough" truly is enough.
