I turned 31 and tried to write about the changes I'd gone through. The words didn't come out right. I couldn't put my finger on what had actually shifted.

I used to avoid confrontation. I'd let things build up in my head, replay conversations I should've had, and feel worse for not having them. Difficult conversations scared me because I thought they'd expose something about me I didn't want to see.

Then something changed. Over the past year, I kept hearing the same thing from different people: "You've grown." That made me stop and think about what they were actually seeing.

When I turned 30, I decided to stop performing and start figuring out who I actually am. I looked at the people around me I admired and tried to understand what made them that way. I started being more assertive, more open, more honest -- even when it was uncomfortable. Especially when it was uncomfortable.

Today I can say I'm happy with who I am. I own my strengths and my weaknesses. I know where I need to improve without it undermining what I've already done. I'm more confident in going after what I want. Not because I figured out some secret -- but because I stopped running from the hard parts.

In the past, I would shy away,
From confrontations, I'd stray.
Now I've learned, and I can say,
Confronting helps me find my way.
