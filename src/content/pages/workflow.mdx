## Development Workflow

Using a simple combination of tmux with neovim gives me the sweet spot to configure it specifically to my needs. How this all works can be found in my [dotfiles](https://github.com/oscarteg/dotfiles).

## Daily Process

I am using Things to get a simple Getting Things Done workflow. Putting every single task and thought in a bucket and every morning reviewing all the tasks that could be done gives me a sense of control. I don't do everything at once but I never forget what needs to be done.

Every morning/evening I try to think about the goals of the day and reflect on how the day went.

## Workflow for learning

- Anki for when I need to stamp knowledge into my brain. Useful for learning a new language.
- Obsidian for building a second brain witha all the information I want to learn.
- Habitify for learning a new skill.
