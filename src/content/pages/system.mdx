{/* Notes
- moving to more writing and less digital
- not forcing myself to write everyday,
  - not writing for the sake of writing
  - my thoughts don't force itself
- as a programmer digital note taking in obsidian is easier to also include code snippets
- trying to go from notes on a subject to blog post
- removing limits by thinking it has to be "perfect"

As someone who has a lot of problem with focussing I try my best to keep an organized mind. I have tried a lot of different "systems" and followed a lot of youtuber, but recently I found a Youtuber that gave me a the insight into a new way of working, learning and living. This is a combination of digital and analog note taking and using the tools as I want. As a software developer I spend more time behind a computer then not. Sometimes time fades and I drift into the digital world for hours on end. I want to be more present and focus on the world around me. Thats why I want to move to a more analoug note taking.

As I have mentioned, I have tried a lot of systems for note taking, project/task management and journaling. But I forced myself to much. I forced myself to write everyday which I don't like. Following the process for the sake of the process is really counter productive. Forcing to have relevant thoughts when my reminder said I needed to, this was just not for me. I was paralyzed by the idea of __doing it the perfect way__ and ultimately did nothing. 

These are my tools and how I use them.

## Analogue
I have four notebooks. Each notebook has a different purpose and each notebook has a different size. These are my bread and butter and contain my sense of self. I like philosophy and think that writing down how I think about the world can contain a glimpse of who I am.

- **Japanese**; for now this is japanese, but it is more the idea of single notebook for learning a new skill. This could be anything that you want. Write your thoughts, notes, draw
- **Journal**; for me there is a distinction between a journal and a diary. A journal are my thoughts and has a more philosophical nature. A diary is more of a log of what I did that day. This journal is used for deep thinking and sort of metacognition. I try to follow the structure where I, write down in clear terms what I want to say, give arguments for the question or statement and even more important address the counter-arguments.
- **Commonplace**; this idea i got from a youtuber but I really like it. This is a notebook where I write down quotes, lines from songs, poetry, wise statements I found somewhere. Nothing is my original thought — but all of it struck me as meaningful when I wrote it down. This is a notebook where I can write down things that I want to remember and maybe think about later. 
- **Pocketnotebook**; this is a small notebook that I can take with me everywhere. This is for ideas, thoughts, things I want to think about later. This is a catch all for my mind.

## Digital e-reader
Analogue books are mine and I want to use them how I want. I write in them, underline, cross out, write my thoughts. I recently started doing this and I've noticied that I paid more attention. My e-reader is used for novels. Things I just want to read and don't want to remember recall.

## Raindrop

- My collection of bookmarks

## Obsidian
My digital note taking, focused on work and proffesional subjects

## Excalidraw
With my drawing tablet I use this to draw diagrams and mindmaps and help me create visual representations of mostly software subjects 

##  Goodnotes
I have some software books that I want to read and take notes on. I use goodnotes for this. I can read the pdf and take notes on the side. These are books that require some back and forth between pages and consist of subject that contain a lot of code samples and diagrams

## Things
All my tasks that I need to do. Catch all is the most important where I put don't everything as small as taking out the garbage and as big as an idea that I have and need to put elsewhere. 

things 
 -> **inbox** for everything
 -> **today** for tasks that i want to do today
 -> **anytime** for tasks that i want to do but not today
 -> **someday** for tasks that i want to do but not anytime soon
 -> projects
    -> this year
    -> next year
## Day One
This is my digital diary. I found a new purpose for this. I forced myself to have a prompt of questions and answer them like most of the journal things you see on Youtube. Most of the time I was empty and didn't feel like writing something down. Now I just do digital content. A simple video recording of something where I am or a picture. Maybe a monoloque with myself in the car. I feel like this does more for me where I can recall certain moments and memories with less effort then writing every thought that I have or everything that happened.
