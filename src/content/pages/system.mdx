title: my system
---

- moving to more writing and less digital
- not forcing myself to write everyday,
  - not writing for the sake of writing
  - my thoughts don't force itself
- as a programmer digital note taking in obsidian is easier to also include code snippets
- trying to go from notes on a subject to blog post
- removing limits by thinking it has to be "perfect"
