Hey, Iâ€™m Oscar. I'm a developer, aspired writer, and user of many
technologies.

I am a social and driven software developer. My father has involved
me in the computer from an early age and through proper guidance and
training it has led to a passion for technology. I have a broad
field of interest and that can also be seen in the various
techniques and technologies I have used the years. During and after
his studies, I mainly developed in the field of web development.

I have studied self-study into various technologies and software
architectures. I can be described as a social, enthusiastic and
communicatively skilled software engineer. I have a passion for my
profession, work hard and like to contribute to a positive working
atmosphere. My ambition is to work in a dynamic environment with an
open culture and passionate employees. The ideal organization
delivers an (innovative) product or service with real added value to
the largest possible audience.
