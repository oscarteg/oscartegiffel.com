Hi there! I'm Oscar, a skilled Senior Fullstack Engineer who absolutely loves creating amazing web experiences. Currently, I work at HeadFWD, a cool consulting agency. In my role, I lead projects and help bring new ideas to life through better processes and technology.

As a developer, I believe in more than just keeping up with the latest trends. I also focus on fostering a positive culture that promotes growth and teamwork. My main aim is to bring teams together and align their goals, so that everyone can thrive in a supportive environment.

Besides being an expert in frontend development with React, I also have a strong grasp of software architecture and backend development. My main goal is to deliver high-quality solutions that not only meet the business requirements, but also provide a great user experience.
