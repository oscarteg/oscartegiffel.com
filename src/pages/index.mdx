Hey, I'm Oscar. 

I'm currenly working as Senior Frontend Engineer at a medium consultancy agency HeadFWD. I focus on improving the companies through process and technology improvements.  

I'm passionate to grow as a developer and not only focus on the technology but also on focussing on building a culture. Connecting teams and aligning goals my personal goal and I'm looking for carying out that goal at each company.

I love building for the web. I focus on frontend development in React but carry a lot more knowledge about architecture and backend development.
