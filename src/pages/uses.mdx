## Editor & Terminal

- Terminal: Ghostty
- Editors: Neovim, Visual Studio Code, Intellij

## Development Workflow

Using a simple combination of tmux with neovim gives me the sweet spot to configure it specifically to my needs. How this all works can be found in my [dotfiles](https://github.com/oscarteg/dotfiles).

## Daily Process

I use __Things__ for a simple Getting Things Done workflow. Every single task and thought goes into a bucket, and every week I review all the tasks. I don't do everything at once but I never forget what needs to be done.

Every morning and evening I reflect on goals and write it down in __Day One__ journal.

## Learning Workflow

- __Anki__ for stamping knowledge into my brain. Useful for learning a new language.
- __Obsidian__ for note taking. No overengineering with the Zettelkasten method anymore.
- __Habitify__ for building new skills.
