## Development Workflow

Using a simple combination of tmux with neovim gives me the sweet spot to configure it specifically to my needs. How this all works can be found in my [dotfiles](https://github.com/oscarteg/dotfiles).

## Daily Process

I am using __Things__ to get a simple Getting Things Done workflow. Putting every single task and thought in a bucket and every week reviewing all the tasks that could be done gives me a sense of control. I don't do everything at once but I never forget what needs to be done.

Every morning/evening I try to think about the goals of the day and reflect on how the day went and write it down in __Day One__ journal.

## Workflow for learning

- __Anki__ for when I need to stamp knowledge into my brain. Useful for learning a new languge.
- __Obsidian__ for building a ~second brain~ note taking. I don't want to overengineer anymore with the Zettelkasten method.
- __Habitify__ for learning a new skill.
